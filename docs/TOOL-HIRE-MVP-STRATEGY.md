# üéØ AskToddy Tool Hire MVP Strategy

## New USP: "The Wikipedia of Construction Tools"

**Not competing on price aggregation, but becoming THE knowledge authority for tool selection and usage**

## üöÄ MVP Approach (Can Launch This Week)

### 1. **Tool Knowledge System** ‚úÖ BUILT
- Comprehensive tool specifications
- "When to use what" decision trees  
- Buy vs rent calculators
- Safety requirements
- Pro tips from 30+ years experience

### 2. **Indicative Pricing** (Simple)
Just use 3 sources for price ranges:
- **HSS** - National baseline
- **Speedy** - Comparison point
- **Regional variance** - "Local suppliers typically 20-30% cheaper"

No need for 33 suppliers initially!

### 3. **Smart Recommendations**
When user asks: "I need to dig a trench for drainage"

AskToddy responds with:
```
For a drainage trench (assuming 10m x 60cm x 60cm):

RECOMMENDED TOOL: 1.5 Tonne Mini Excavator
- Why: Perfect size for garden access, 2-hour job vs 2 days by hand
- Specifications: 990mm width (fits through standard gate)
- Hire cost: ¬£80-120/day (national chains), ¬£60-90/day (local suppliers)
- You'll also need: Dumper for spoil (¬£50-75/day)

ALTERNATIVES:
- Hand dig: Free but 2 days hard work
- 0.8T Micro: If very tight access (¬£70-100/day)

SAFETY: 
- Check for underground services first (CAT scan)
- PPE required

PRO TIP: Book Friday collection for weekend use at daily rate

WHERE TO HIRE:
- National: HSS or Speedy (reliable but pricier)
- East England: Toddy Tool Hire (best local rates)
- Search "tool hire near me" for local options (often 20-30% cheaper)

## üéØ The Big Picture

**We're not trying to be a price comparison site.**

**We're building the most trusted source for "Which tool do I need and should I buy or rent it?"**

This positions AskToddy as:
- The expert advisor (not just a directory)
- The educator (not just prices)  
- The trusted guide (not sales-driven)

And critically: **We can launch THIS WEEK with real value**, then build the pricing layer through partnerships rather than scraping!

**Ready to become the UK's go-to tool knowledge platform?** üöÄ
